In depth data visualization using python
Matplotlib is a plotting library.
This tutorial offers a brief overview of the matplotlib.pyplot module, which provides a plotting system similar to that of MATLAB (which is where Matplotlib gets its name from!).
Matplotlib can output graphs using various backend graphics libraries, such as Tk, wxPython, etc. When running python using the command line, the graphs are typically shown in a separate window. In a Jupyter/Colab notebook, we can simply output the graphs within the notebook itself by running the %matplotlib inline magic command.
